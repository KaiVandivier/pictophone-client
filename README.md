## Pict-o-phone!

This is the client for a Telestrations-like multiplayer game where players take turns drawing prompts and guessing what the previous player drew.

The game takes advantage of socket.io to make realtime connections between clients and the server.

The repository for the server can be found [here](https://github.com/KaiVandivier/pictophone-server).
